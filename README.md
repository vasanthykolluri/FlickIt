FlickIt Demo
=============
Flickit is a flickr based android app that lets you auto-share pics with a group of friends. This is esp useful while going on trips. Most of us tend to defer sharing pics once the trip is done. Flickit takes care of that for you.

- Login to app is based on actual Flickr login (yahoo/google/FB)
- You can create a group for a set of friends and add start and end dates to it.
- Notifications are shown when Group Add requests and responses are received on FlickIt. 
- Friends can accept/decline to be part of the group.
- Pics taken through Flickit by all group members during that period will be automatically uploaded to flickr and shared with the group. You don't have to manually share pics.

We wanted to showcase this idea with this app.
Attached a sample demo. For the pupose of demo, I added myself to show how the group add request and response are notified to a Flickit user.
